This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with raw pointers and vectors. The `bug.rs` file contains code that modifies the vector's data using an unsafe pointer without updating the vector's internal state. This can lead to data corruption or unexpected program behavior.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that uses safe Rust methods to modify the vector's data.
